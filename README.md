# Protenix: Protein + X

A trainable PyTorch reproduction of [AlphaFold 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w).

For more information on the model's performance and capabilities, see our [technical report](Protenix_Technical_Report.pdf).

## Installation

### Run with PyPI (recommended):

```bash
    # maybe you need to update libxrender1 and libxext6 firstly, run as following for Debian:
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install libxrender1
    # apt-get install libxext6
    pip3 install protenix
```
### Run with Docker:

If you're interested in model training, we recommand to [<u> run with docker</u>](docs/docker_installation.md).

## Inference

<details>
<summary> Download model weights </summary>
<p markdown="1">

Use the following command to download pretrained model weight [1.4G]:

```bash
wget -P /af3-dev/release_model/ https://af3-dev.tos-cn-beijing.volces.com/release_model/model_v1.pt 

```
the checkpoint should be placed in the `/af3-dev/release_model/` directory.

<summary> Download dependent files </summary>
<p markdown="1">

`components.v20240608.cif` and `components.v20240608.cif.rdkit_mol.pkl` is used in inference pipeline for generating [ccd](https://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd) reference feature. You can download them by the following command.
```bash
wget -P /af3-dev/release_data/ https://af3-dev.tos-cn-beijing.volces.com/release_data/components.v20240608.cif
wget -P /af3-dev/release_data/ https://af3-dev.tos-cn-beijing.volces.com/release_data/components.v20240608.cif.rdkit_mol.pkl
```

### Command line inference
Note: by default, we use layernorm and EvoformerAttention kernels to speed up inference, see [<u> setting up kernels documentation </u>](docs/kernels.md). you can set environment variable CUTLASS_PATH as follows:

```bash
git clone -b v3.5.1 https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass.git  /path/to/cutlass
export CUTLASS_PATH=/path/to/cutlass
```

If you set up `Protenix` by `pip`, you can run the following command to do model inference:

```bash
# run with one json file
protenix_infer --input_json_path examples/example.json --dump_dir  ./output

# or run with multiple json files
protenix_infer --input_json_path ./jsons_dir/ --dump_dir  ./output

```

**Detailed information on the format of the input JSON file and the output files can be found in [<u> input and output documentation </u>](docs/infer_json_format.md)**.

Alternatively you can run inference by:

```bash
bash inference_demo.sh
```

Arguments in this scripts are explained as follows:
* `load_checkpoint_path`: path to the model checkpoints.
* `input_json_path`: path to a JSON file that fully describes the input.
* `dump_dir`: path to a directory where the results of the inference will be saved. 
* `dtype`: data type used in inference. Valid options include `"bf16"` and `"fp32"`. 
* `use_deepspeed_evo_attention`: whether use the EvoformerAttention provided by DeepSpeed.
* `use_msa`: whether to use the MSA feature, the default is true. If you want to disable the MSA feature, add `--use_msa false` to the [inference_demo.sh](inference_demo.sh) script.


### Notebook demo
You can use [notebooks/protenix_inference.ipynb](notebooks/protenix_inference.ipynb)  to run the model inference.

## Training
If you're interested in model training, see [<u> training documentation </u>](docs/training.md).

## Performance
See the [<u>performance documentation</u>](docs/model_performance.md).

## Acknowledgements

Implementation of the layernorm operators referred to [OneFlow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow) and [FastFold](https://github.com/hpcaitech/FastFold). We used [OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold) for some [module](protenix/openfold_local/) implementations, except the [`LayerNorm`](protenix/model/layer_norm/).
