### Format of the input JSON file
The JSON file format closely resembles that used by the AlphaFold Server, with a few key differences:

1. There are no restrictions on the types of ligands, ions, and modifications, whereas the AlphaFold Server currently supports only a limited set of specific CCD codes.
2. Users can specify bonds between entities, such as covalent bonds between ligands and polymers.
3. It supports inputting ligands in the form of SMILES strings or molecular structure files.
4. Ligands composed of multiple CCD codes can be treated as a single entity. This feature is useful for representing glycans, for example, "NAG-NAG".
5. The "glycans" field is no longer supported. Glycans can be fully represented by inputting multiple ligands with defined bonding or by providing their SMILES strings.

Here is an overview of the JSON file format:
```json
[ 
  {
    "name": "Test Fold Job Number One",
    "sequences": [...],
    "covalent_bonds": [...]
  }
]
```
The JSON file consists of a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a set of sequences you want to model. 
Even if you are modeling only one set of sequences, the top-level structure should still be a list.

Each dictionary contains the following three keys:
* `name`: A string representing the name of the inference job.
* `sequences`: A list of dictionaries that describe the entities (e.g., proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules, and ions) involved in the inference.
* `covalent_bonds`: An optional list of dictionaries that define the covalent bonds between atoms from different entities.

Details of `sequences` and `covalent_bonds` are provided below.

#### sequences
There are 5 kinds of supported sequences:
*   `proteinChain` – used for proteins
*   `dnaSequence` – used for DNA (single strand)
*   `rnaSequence` – used for RNA (single strand)
*   `ligand` – used for ligands
*   `ion` – used for ions

##### proteinChain
```json
{
  "proteinChain": {
    "sequence": "PREACHINGS", 
    "count": 1,
    "modifications": [
      {
        "ptmType": "CCD_HY3", 
        "ptmPosition": 1,
      },
      {
        "ptmType": "CCD_P1L",
        "ptmPosition": 5
      }
    ],
    "msa":{
      "precomputed_msa_dir": "./precomputed_msa",
      "pairing_db": "uniref100",
    },
  },
}
```
* `sequence`: A string representating a protein sequence, which can only contain the 20 standard amino acid type and X (UNK) for unknown residues.
* `count`: The number of copies of this protein chain (integer).
* `modifications`: An optional list of dictionaries that describe post-translational modifications.

  * `ptmType`: A string containing CCD code of the modification. 
  * `ptmPosition`: The position of the modified amino acid (integer).
* `msa`: A dictionary containing options for Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). **If you want to search MSAs using our inference pipeline, you should not set this field or set it to an empty dictionary**:
  * `precomputed_msa_dir`: The path to a directory containing precomputed MSAs. This directory should contain two specific files: "pairing.a3m" for MSAs used for pairing, and "non_pairing.a3m" for non-pairing MSAs.
  * `pairing_db`: The name of the genomic database used for pairing MSAs. The default is "uniref100" and you should not change it. In fact, The MSA search against the UniRef30, a clustered version of the UniRef100.

##### dnaSequence
```json
{
  "dnaSequence": {
      "sequence": "GATTACA",
      "modifications": [
          {
              "modificationType": "CCD_6OG",
              "basePosition": 1
          },
          {
              "modificationType": "CCD_6MA",
              "basePosition": 2

  }
},
{
    "dnaSequence": {
        "sequence": "TGTAATC",
        "count": 1

Please note that the `dnaSequence` type refers to a single stranded DNA sequence. If you
wish to model double-stranded DNA, please add a second `dnaSequence` entry representing
the sequence of the reverse complement strand.

##### ligand
```json
{
    "ligand": {
        "ligand": "CCD_ATP",
        "count": 1
    }
},
{
    "ligand": {
        "ligand": "FILE_your_file_path/atp.sdf",
        "count": 1
    }
},
{

        "count": 1
    }
}
```
* `ligand`: A string representing the ligand. `ligand` can be one of the following three:
  * A string containing the CCD code of the ligand, prefixed with "CCD_". For glycans or similar structures, this can be a concatenation of multiple CCD codes, for example, "CCD_NAG_BMA_BGC".
  * A molecular SMILES string representing the ligand.
  * A path to a molecular structure file, prefixed with "FILE_", where the supported file formats are PDB, SDF, MOL, and MOL2. The file must include the 3D conformation of the molecule.

* `count` is the number of copies of this ligand (integer).

##### ion
```json
{
    "ion": {
        "ion": "MG",
        "count": 2
    }
},
{
    "ion": {
        "ion": "NA",
        "count": 3
    }
}
```
* `ion`: A string containing the CCD code for the ion. Note that, unlike ligands, the ion code **does not** start with "CCD_".
* `count`: The number of copies of this ion (integer).

#### covalent_bonds
```json
"covalent_bonds": [
            {
                "entity1": "2",
                "copy1": 1,
                "position1": "2",
                "atom1": "N6",
                "entity2": "3",
                "copy2": 1,
                "position2": "1",
                "atom2": "C1"
            }
]
```

The `covalent_bonds` section specifies covalent bonds between a polymer and a ligand, or between two ligands.
To define a covalent bond, two atoms involved in the bond must be identified. The following fields are used:

* `entity1`, `entity2`: The entity numbers for the two atoms involved in the bond. 
The entity number corresponds to the order in which the entity appears in the `sequences` list, starting from 1.
* `copy1`, `copy2`: The copy index (starting from 1) of the `left_entity` and `right_entity`, respectively. These fields are optional, but if specified, both `left_copy` and `right_copy` must be filled simultaneously or left empty at the same time. If neither field is provided, a bond will be created between all pairs of copies of the two entities. For example, if both entity1 and entity2 have two copies, a bond will be formed between entity1.copy1 and entity2.copy1, as well as between entity1.copy2 and entity2.copy2. In this case, the number of copies for both entities must be equal.
* `position1`, `position2` - The position of the residue (or ligand part) within the entity. 
The position value starts at 1 and can vary based on the type of entity:
  * For **polymers** (e.g., proteins, DNA, RNA), the position corresponds to the location of the residue in the sequence.
  * For **ligands** composed of multiple CCD codes, the position refers to the serial number of the CCD code.
  * For **single CCD code ligands**, or ligands defined by **SMILES** or **FILE**, the position is always set to 1.
    
* `atom1`, `atom2` - The atom names (or atom indices) of the atoms to be bonded.
  * If the entity is a polymer or described by a CCD code, the atom names are consistent with those defined in the CCD.
  * If the entity is a ligand defined by SMILES or a FILE, atoms can be specified by their atom index. The atom index corresponds to the position of the atom in the file or in the SMILES string, starting from 0.

Deprecation Notice: The previous fields such as old `left_entity`, `right_entity`, and other fields starting with `left`/`right` have been updated to use `1` and `2` to denote the two atoms forming a bond. The current code still supports the old field names, but they may be deprecated in the future, leaving only the new field names. An alternative approach is to write the element name of the specified atom in the SMILES/file, along with its sequential number for that element, e.g., "C2" indicates it is the second carbon.

Here is a revised user guide compatible with **Version 2** of the `constraint` format for the Complex Structure Predictor:

---

### constraint
The `constraint` section specifies additional structural information to enable inter-chain guidance for Protenix. Currently, Protenix support two kind of constraint: `contact` and `pocket` constraint. 
The `contact` constraint allows you to specify residue/atom-residue/atom level priors. The `pocket` constraint is used to guide the binding interface between a chain of interest (e.g. a ligand or an antibody) and specific residues in another chain (e.g. epitopes).

> 💡 *This is a **soft constraint**: the model is encouraged, but not strictly required, to satisfy it.*

#### contact constraint

The contact field is a list of dictionaries, each defining a distance constraint between two residues or specific atoms. The format uses explicit, named keys for clarity and flexibility.

##### Example:

```json
"contact": [
    {
        "entity1": 1,
        "copy1": 1,
        "position1": 169,
        "entity2": 2,
        "copy2": 1,
        "position2": 1,
        "atom2": "C5",
        "max_distance": 6,
        "min_distance": 0
    }, // token-contact
    {
        "entity1": 1,
        "copy1": 1,
        "position1": 169,
        "atom1": "CA",
        "entity2": 2,
        "copy2": 1,
        "position2": 1,
        "max_distance": 6,
        "min_distance": 0
    }, // token-contact
    {
        "entity1": 1,
        "copy1": 1,
        "position1": 169,
        "entity2": 2,
        "copy2": 1,
        "position2": 1,
        "max_distance": 6,
        "min_distance": 0
    }, // token-contact
    {
        "entity1": 1,
        "copy1": 1,
        "position1": 169,
        "atom1": "CA",
        "entity2": 2,
        "copy2": 1,
        "position2": 1,
        "atom2": "C5",
        "max_distance": 6,
        "min_distance": 3
    }, // atom-contact
    ...
]
```

Each contact dictionary includes the following keys:
* entity1, copy1, position1 (required)
  Specifies the first residue: entity (entity number), copy (copy index), position (residue index).

*  atom1 (optional)
  Name of the specific atom in the first residue (e.g., "CA", "C5"). If omitted, the distance constraint is applied at the token granularity by default, specifically the central atom of the token.

* entity2, copy2, position2 (required)
  Specifies the second residue.

* atom2 (optional)
Specific atom in the second residue.

* `max_distance` (float):
  The **expected maximum distance** (in Ångströms) between the specified residues or atoms.
* `min_distance` (float):
  The **expected minimum distance** (in Ångströms) between the specified residues or atoms. For token-contact, you do not need to specify this field. It is 0 by default.

#### pocket constraint

The `pocket` constraint is defined as a dictionary with three keys: `"binder_chain"`, `"contact_residues"`, and `"max_distance"` to allow chain-residue binding specification.

##### Example

```json
"pocket": {
  "binder_chain": 
    {        
      "entity": 2,
      "copy": 1
    }, 
  "contact_residues": [
    {
      "entity": 1,
      "copy": 1,
      "position": 126
    },
    ...
  ], 
  "max_distance": 6
}
```

* `binder_chain` (dict):
  Specifies the **binder chain** in the format:  `{ "entity": <int>, "copy": <int> }`

* `contact_residues` (list of dict):
  A list of residue  that are expected to be in spatial proximity (i.e., in or near the binding pocket). Each residue is specified as:
  `{ "entity": <int>, "copy": <int>, "position": <int> }`

* `max_distance` (float):
  The **maximum allowed distance** (in Ångströms) between the binder and the specified contact residues.


### Format of the model output
The outputs will be saved in the directory provided via the `--dump_dir` flag in the inference script. The outputs include the predicted structures in CIF format and the confidence in JSON files. The `--dump_dir` will have the following structure:

```bash
├── <name>/  # specified in the input JSON file
│   ├── <seed>/  # specified via the `--seeds` flag in the inference script
│   │   ├── <name>_<seed>_sample_0.cif
│   │   ├── <name>_<seed>_summary_confidence_sample_0.json
│   │   └──... # the number of samples in each seed is specified via `--sample_diffusion.N_sample ` flag in the inference script
│   └──...
└── ...
```

The contents of each output file are as follows:
- `<name>_<seed>_sample_*.cif` - A CIF format text file containing the predicted structure
- `<name>_<seed>_summary_confidence_sample_*.json` - A JSON format text file containing various confidence scores for assessing the reliability of predictions. Here’s a description of each score:

    - `plddt` - Predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) score. Higher values indicate greater confidence.
    - `gpde` - Globl Predicted Distance Error (PDE) score. Lower values indicate greater confidence.
    - `ptm` - Predicted TM-score (pTM). Values closer to 1 indicate greater confidence.
    - `iptm` - Interface Predicted TM-score, used to estimate the accuracy of interfaces between chains. Values closer to 1 indicate greater confidence.
    - `chain_ptm` - pTM score calculated for individual chains with the shape of [N_chains], indicating the reliability of specific chain structure.
    - `chain_pair_iptm`: Pairwise interface pTM scores between chain pairs with the shape of [N_chains, N_chains], indicating the reliability of specific chain-chain interactions.
    - `chain_iptm` - Average ipTM scores for each chain with the shape of [N_chains].
    - `chain_pair_iptm_global` - Averge `chain_iptm` between chain pairs with the shape of [N_chains, N_chains]. For interface containing a small molecule, ion, or bonded ligand chain (named `C*`), this value is equal to the `chain_iptm` value of `C*`. 
    - `chain_plddt` - pLDDT scores calculated for individual chains with the shape of [N_chains].
    - `chain_pair_plddt` - Pairwise pLDDT scores for chain pairs with the shape of [N_chains, N_chains].
    - `has_clash` - Boolean flag indicating if there are steric clashes in the predicted structure.
    - `disorder` - Predicted regions of intrinsic disorder within the protein, highlighting residues that may be flexible or unstructured.
    - `ranking_score` - Predicted confidence score for ranking complexes. Higher values indicate greater confidence.
    - `num_recycles`: Number of recycling steps used during inference.
